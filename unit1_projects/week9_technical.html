        <p>
          Two of my sisters were pretty good artists and their work was revered by our high school art teacher.  When it came my turn to take an art class, all I could do was struggle to the point where my art teacher said "Adam, I just don't get.  Your sisters were great artists...".  My issues had less to do translating something else onto the page...but far more to do <<em>envisioning</em>.  I could execute the concepts in my head, there were just terrible concepts!

          This has definatley spread into my early work building websites.  I can make them I envision them in my mind...it's just that what I envision looks really, really bad. I've developed a technique, and a good one to combat this.  It's called "looking at a goodlooking website...then making yours look like that". Now, I'm not saying I <em>plagarize</em> it.  Instead, I look to a good website to get ideas for what might look good.  Find what elements you like.  Do you like the layout?  The colors?  Pick and choose from different sites, and then make it your own. This blog template did not spring from my own imagination: it came from getting inspiration from several other blogs.  Take what I like, modify it to my liking, throw the rest away.

          Designing a web page gives me a whole new level of respect for designers.  It's extremely difficult for many of us to come up with a vision of a good looking, well laid out site.  And that's okay.  Design is a skill that must be studied, perfected and executed.  Sprucing up <a href="http://ahardy55.github.io">my page</a>, it <em>still</em> doesn't look so hot. It's kind of ugly (I used a not-so-hot looking site as inspiration.  Bad idea!), the nav bar is pretty ugly, yet it is still about 100 times more beautiful than anything I could dream up myself.
