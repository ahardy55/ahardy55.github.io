        <p>
         Upton watching <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014"> Shereef Bishay's talk about kitchen vs table expectations</a> at Dev Bootcamp, I had a number of conflicting emotions, not all them nice.  Those included: 1. Are you saying it's wrong for a student who is paying $12,000 to have very large expectations of the quality of education at DBC? 2. Why are the two mutually exclusive?  Why shouldn't we be expected to work hard and make it our own and <em>also</em> maintain the expectation that Dev Bootcamp owe us a good educational experience to some degree?  How I will fit into Dev Bootcamp is largely dependent on how those theories are put into practice in real life. 
        </p>

        <p>
          To get one thing perfectly clear: one <em>should</em> have extremely high expectations of Dev Bootcamp, their education quality and staff.  You are putting forth $12,000 for 9 weeks based on the idea that they can teach you software development(and judging by their alumni, this certainly seems very true).   That being said, such demands an obvious two way street.  Learning software development is certainly not something you can lazy your way through, expecting to pick up the skills to be a developer by doing the bare minimum amount of work.  At no point has Dev Bootcamp ever sugar-coated or tried to minimize the amount of work a student has to put in.  They are very clear about their role as <em>guiding</em> through the learning process, and that you will only improve as a developer but pushing yourself to the limit.  
        </p>

        <p>
          Where Shefeef lost me was his implications that "we are all in this together".  Well, we aren't.  We, in fact, <em>are your customers</em>, and thinking differently from a business standpoint is a very dangerous thing.  A company cannot absolve itself of it's responsibility to it's customers, such as changing policy midstream, ignoring incompetence if it arises or simply laying the blame for a lacking educational experience on the feet of the student for not "making the most of it".  Dev Bootcamp demands much of their students and it's only fair of the students to demand much of Dev Bootcamp.  (I do wish to reiterate that, given the results of students that comes out of Dev Bootcamp, they certainly to be doing their job pretty well!).
        </p>

         <p>
           It shouldn't be the kitchen vs. the table.  It should be the kitchen <em>and</em> the table.  Dev Bootcamp students should be expected to do everything in their power to make their education experience as good as possible and push themselves as far as they can do.  By the same token, this does not absolve Dev Bootcamp of their responsibility to their customers.  They owe it them to push <em>themselves</em> as far as they can go to educate them as much as possible.
