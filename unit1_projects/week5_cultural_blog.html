      <article>
        <p>
          The software developer community is filled with those who live and breathe code.  Many Companies routinely demand 60-70 hour week from their developers, and those developers love to brag about how hard they work about the hours they put in. Code is their life...yet neither the employer nor the developer seems to realize that those 60-70 hour weeks produce <em>less</em> than a 40 hour week would.  By being a workaholic, you are harming your own health to do a worse job!
        </p>

        <p>
          Common sense indicates that if you produce 10 widgets an hour, you'll produce 400 widgets in a 40 hour week and 60 widgets in a 60 hour week.  This logic would hold up if people were robots.  Instead, we wear down, we mess up, and as we as we tire, we become inefficient.  In a 2012 article on <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/03/14/bring_back_the_40_hour_work_week/">Salon.com</a>, Sara Robinson pointed the folly of demanding more than 40 hours form your employees. 

          <blockquote>
            Evan Robinson, a software engineer with a long interest in programmer productivity (full disclosure: our shared last name is not a coincidence) summarized this history in a white paper he wrote for the International Game Developers' Association in 2005. The original paper contains a wealth of links to studies conducted by businesses, universities, industry associations and the military that supported early-20th-century leaders as they embraced the short week. "Throughout the '30s, '40s and '50s, these studies were apparently conducted by the hundreds," writes Robinson; "and by the 1960s, the benefits of the 40-hour week were accepted almost beyond question in corporate America. In 1962, the Chamber of Commerce even published a pamphlet extolling the productivity gains of reduced hours." <br/><br/>

            What these studies showed, over and over, was that industrial workers have eight good, reliable hours a day in them. On average, you get no more widgets out of a 10-hour day than you do out of an eight-hour day. Likewise, the overall output for the work week will be exactly the same at the end of six days as it would be after five days. So paying hourly workers to stick around once they've put in their weekly 40 is basically nothing more than a stupid and abusive way to burn up profits. Let 'em go home, rest up and come back on Monday. It's better for everybody.
          </blockquote> <br/><br/>

          Robinson goes on to explain that <em>short term</em> gains can be had by pushing extra hard to meet a deadline, but that those gains are not proportional to the additional hours. If the process continues long enough, you will actually hit a point of <em>diminishing</em> returns...the 60-hour worker becomes less efficient than the 40-hour-worker.
        </p>   

        <p>
          Everyone likes to believe they are the exception...but that isn't the case. In fact, common sense should indicate that a tired programmer would produce worse code!  There may be more of it, but it will require far more debugging, refactoring and general un-cruding(yes, un-cruding is a word now).  Not only are you be inefficient, you're harming your health in the process. <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2014/01/working-hours?fsrc=rss">A recent study cited in the Economist</a> showed a strong correlation between working excessive hours and pre-mature death.  It can cause intense strain on your personal life and relationships and, generally erodes the quality of your life. And remember: <em>you're becoming a less efficient worker in the process!</em> 
        </p> 

        <p>
          The cost of continually working excessive hours is inefficiency, loss of a personal life and risk to your health.  Yet, companies and employees insist on continuing this practice. If you run a company, be selfish!  Send your employees home after 40-hours!  After 40 hours, they're continued presence is <em>harming</em> you!  If you are an employee who feels dedicated to his employer, do them a favor: go home!  We need to remember: we are not the exception.  Studies have continually shown that the 40-hour worker is happier and produces more than his 60-hour counterpart.  We need to start believing the studies instead of the anecdotes.
