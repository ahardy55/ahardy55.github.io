		  <span class="title">The Stereotype Threat</span>
      <article>
        <p>
          Stereotype threat is the very troubling and harmful phenomenon in which the <em>fear</em> of confirming a stereotype about one's sex/race/group/etc inhibits performance.  It can drive down test scores for African-Americans, it can inhibit athletic performance of white men, it can drive women from careers in math and science. Fortunately, the issue can be combated.
        </p>

        <p>
          The concept of stereotype threat was identified and introduced by sociologists Claude Steele and Joshua Aaronson.  Their studies showed that African-Americans performed worse on tests that they were told were testing for "intellectual ability" then if they were given the exact same test and told it was simply "a laboratory problem-solving task".  The fear of perpetuating a negative stereotype actually lead to reduced test scores.  The problem goes beyond testing.  A <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/07/12/156664337/stereotype-threat-why-women-quit-science-jobs">2012 NPR story</a> detailed how stereotype threat can drive women from the sciences.  The results of stereotype threat can embolden those who believe in racial/gender superiority, creating a sort of Catch-22: the threat exists because of those who put forth stereotypes, which leads to a stereotype threat that can inhibit performance which can then be used to ammunition for those who put forth stereotypes!

          Fortunately, the issue can be combated.  As a future tech employee, assisting in combating stereotype threat is essential for a health working environment.  It requires both A). recognizing situations where stereotype threats arise, B). finding ways to reduce the vulnerable feelings of those experiencing it.  Most information on the subject contains high-level solutions to stereotype threats and very little about what non-management can do to help ease the issue in a workplace...which probably doesn't include most of you.  The most important and helpful thing you can do to combat the issue is by being open about your struggles with others.  Show that the these struggles are universal, and not the result of someone's gender or race.  If you catch yourself perpetuating a stereotype, recognize how you are doing so and how that stereotype is affecting others.  And realize that those whose performance is being hindered by stereotype threat likely aren't aware that that is the issue. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Stereotype threat is settle, hard to recognize yet extremely harmful.  Only by being conscience of the issue and being proactive in combating it can you help reduce the harm is causes.
