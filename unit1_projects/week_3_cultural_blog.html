		  <span class="title">The Joyous and Not-So-Joyous Moments of Pairing</span>
      <article>

          Ahhh pairing...the part of learning programming that is at once the most rewarding and most frustrating.  On one hand, you have a partner to who helps you through the code, bounces idea off of you and is a person to revel in your success with.  On the other hand, it's someone you are forced to expose your ignorance to, can at times slow the process down greatly and can occasionally be stubborn and greatly inhibit the process.  The result is a lesson that no programmer works in a vacuum.  As frustrating as it can be at times, the result is a much better learning experience that can also prepare you for working in a pair-programming job and successfully communicating with co-workers at jobs that don't do pair programming.

          I had initially started Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp in early January, but 5 weeks in, two hospitalizations and a surgery caused me to defer a couple of months.  The result is that I have a fair amount more pairing experience than my fellow students.  What I've seen so far is that the biggest detriment to a pair is lack of confidence.  Being a silent partner makes you nothing more that a transcriber.  It's frustrating to feel like you're carrying the pair without input.  I quickly discovered that it is better to be wrong than to be silent.  Surprisingly, the silence was an issue with nearly every session I had in the previous cohort, but has yet to be a problem with the new one despite far less experience (so far...).  I've already learned more in my few pairings in the new cohort than I did all the last ones.  Having a vocal partner who will question you, ask for clarification is they don't understand something and not hesitate to offer their opinion of how the code should go forward not only makes the coding experience far better, but makes for much better code!

          Writing feedback is another important.  Dev Bootcamp uses the "feedbackinator" for students to give anonymous feedback after pairing.   Ain't none of us perfect, and it is usually easier for someone from the outside to see what you can improve upon that you yourself.  Unfortunately, I have yet to actually receive feedback from a fellow pair.  I'll take this to mean that I am one of those rare perfect people and begin to nurture a very large superiority complex.  More likely, the feedback just hasn't enough votes okaying it to be sent to me (the feedbackinator has the feedback get rated before it's sent to you, making sure it is specific, actionable and kind).   Making actionable criticism is definitely the hardest part...no one wants to see like a judgemental jerk, but it is also the most important.  Otherwise, what is the purpose besides just telling someone how swell they are?  Unfortunately, this is also the part that seems to be missing from most feedback.  Come on guys, we're all grownups here!

        Pairing can be both a blessing and a curse, but on the whole extremely beneficial.  There is a reason companies will pay two programmers a rather high salary to code together.  It simply makes for a much higher quality product.  Building your pairing skills can be as important as building your coding skills.  More important, <em>pairing actually builds those skills</em>.
