          As a burgeoning software developer, the one the  has thoroughly destroyed, humbled and intimidated me more than any other is "rails".  Rails, that confusing framework of countless folders, 90% of which you don't know the purpose of.  With it's MVC's and ActiveRecord's.  Nothing is more daunting than completing your first "FizzBuzz", feeling all badass, then looking at an actual Rails App.  You realize how petty and small your skills are, and how far you have to go.  Fortunately, Rails is actually <em> helpful</em> in the long run!
        </p>

         <p>
          Rails is a full stack software development framework.  You can build pages, create and modify your routes, query the database, render templates, etc through the Rails framework. It utilized the MVC (model-view-controller) to organize applications.  Even with my limited experience, I could fill another whole blog entry just on this subject: but in short, the model handles data, the controller receives requests and calls the appropriate actions and the view displays those actions.  Once learned, the layout fairly intuitive and well organized.  Rails delivers your entire framework on a (relatively) easy to understand platter!
        </p>

        <p>
         The dark side for a newbie is the complete and utter intimidation you get when you view your first rails app.  It's easy to want to throw up your hands.  The code you write while practicing and honing your skills ends up being pretty far removed from practical ruby code that queries databases, configures routes and controls the action on the page (I've yet to find a decent tutorial that closes this gap!).  When you are starting out, it is extremely easy to get lost: to mess up an area and have no idea how to get it fixed. 
       </p>

       <p>
         With all that being said, software development isn't easy, but Rails makes it a bit easier.  A stupendous number of resources exist to aid you in learning this framework.  And remember, everything you learned about programming up this point has been confusing, scary and ultimately mastered.  Why should Rails be any different?
