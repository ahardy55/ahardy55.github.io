      <span class="title">Feedback That Works</span>
        <p>
          The point of feedback isn't to criticize.  That would serve no purpose except to put the receiver on the defensive.  The point it to help improve.  This is an area where a lot of people seem to miss the point.  Much of the feedback I've rated in the feedbackinator either A). Simply criticized or B). was too polite to actually be considered feedback. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          DBC argues that good feedback is "specific, actionable and kind".  You aren't just complimenting them!(which made up a shockingly large amount of feedback I had to rate). 
          <li>Specific: What exactly was good and bad</li>
          <li>Actionable: If there's nothing that can be done, what's the point of giving feedback on it?  At that point, it's just an observation</li>
          <li>Kind: Feedback is much more likely to be implemented if give it in a kind fashion</li>
        </p>

        <p>
          The best feedback I received:
          <blockquote>Really enjoyed working with you. I feel like we had complimentary understandings of the material; where I had trouble, you filled it it, and vice versa. Really enjoyable. One thing I would mention is that it's totally okay to stop things earlier in the process if you're confused, but I could work on explaining myself more clearly. Hope to work with you again!</blockquote>

          This feedback hit all the points.  It's specific, it's kind, and it is actionable. I have a tendency to keep going until I hope something clicks.  This is fine enough when I'm working with myself, but obviously an issue when pairing.  This is great feedback and something I will certainly keep in my mind my next pairing session. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The worst feedback I received:
          <blockquote>
            Most of this pairing session was spent focusing on soft skills as well as hard skills. You are very even-keeled and easy to work with, which made settling into Driver/Navigator rolls seamless. Good session!
          </blockquote>

          Though nice, there is really nothing here.  Being easy to work with is nice and all, but that knowledge is not helping me improve my pairing skills in any way.  (My apologies to whomever wrote this!  I'm glad you enjoyed pairing with me, but please be more specific next time!)
        </p>

        <p>
          That's not to say feedback always has to have a negative aspect to it.  Obviously, if there is no negative, you shouldn't merely throw it in as a way to fulfill an obligation.  But <em>specifically</em> going over the positives can be extremely beneficial as well. I may be incidently doing something extremely positive that I'm not aware of.  Recieving positive feedback helps me know that it IS a positive.
