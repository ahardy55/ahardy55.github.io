//What is this referring to? Think programming-wise rather than in the terms of the game.
// It refers to the owner of the function we're executing. 

//What does the () do in JavaScript?
// Holds functions and parameters

//What is the point of the semicolons?
// They act like periods, used to separate statements

//Reflection
//This is a weird one to reflect one.  I actually didn't learn anything from this exercise...I knew a bit of Javascript already, and this one mostly just seemed to be writing the moveRight function with no information as to what went on behind it.  The difficulty was in figuring out the game itself, not so much the actual coding.  No sir... I didn't like it one bit.
