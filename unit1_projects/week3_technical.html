      <article>
        <p>
          If you're learning software development, odds are Javascript is one the first things you have to learn.  But why?  Why is Javascript so popular and why is it necessary for you to master all those {} () and ;'s?  
        </p>

        <p>
          Javascript is a client-side programming language that allows user interaction.  Whether you realize it or not, most websites you have been to have used Javascript. In addition to page interaction, it can detect your browser, validate forms, create cookies and more.
          Want a pop-up window to appear when a user clicks a link, use Javascript (...in fact,don't.  Everyone hates pop-up windows).  Want to manipulate or animate elements on your page?  Why, Javascript can do that too.  It can take a page from being boring, flat and add dept and interactivity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Why is Javascript so popular?  Well, it's fairly easy to learn and use.  Popularity leads to even more popularity: the more it's used, the more tools that are created for it that encourages even further use.  A virtually endless host of tools are available to make learning and utilizing Javascript easier by the day.  Add those together, and you get a language that is not only basically the standard to client-side programming, but virtually mandatory for any would-be programmer to learn. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Learning Javascript, like any language can be intimidating.  But thanks to it's overwhelming popularity, it's easier today than ever before. Countless online tutorials exist to get your feet wet.  Thousands of your questions have already been answered by people on sites like <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>.  Countless tools for assisting in Javascript are available to you.
