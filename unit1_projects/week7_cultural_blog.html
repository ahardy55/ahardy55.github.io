          I have a confession to make: I hate writing these blogs.  <em>I haaaaate it</em>.  It feels as though I'm being forced to have an opinion on a topic I really don't care about to fulfill a completely arbitrary directive.  They haven't been for me and they hardly reflect my feelings on the issues because largely I <em>don't</em> have feelings on these issues.  I tend to think things like "affirming your values" is a little bit bullshit and does little to reflect the real world. In fact, I'm going to do my best to erase the existence of them so they are not read by potential employers.  Curiously, this feeling actually does dovetail into this week's blog topic. I won't relate it to stereotype threat, a subject that I wrote an extremely hollow and empty post on, but I will relate it to the idea of what to do when you start feeling down.

          These blogs have been an infinately frustrating experience for me...easily the most frustrating aspect of Phase 0.  But, they must be done.  My reaction to them has been procrastination, complaining, starts and stops because finally saying "to hell with it", spitting out some poor, unoriginal, uninteresting words on the a topic.  This is obviously not the best way to accomplish the task at hand.  In any job, I'm going to have to do work that I don't like doing and that I don't feel qualified doing. Granted, the major difference will likely be that there is a <em>point</em> to doing the job at hand (I said I really hate these blog topics!), but the fact remains: they must be done. So, what are some exercises I could do to mitigate the extreme frustration I feel when writing the blogs?
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Realize the purpose of these blogs.  It's not to write something amazing or game changing.  It's to solidify my own learning and possibly provide information that someone else can benefit from</li>
          <li> Identify what I'm doing to sabatoge myself. The more frutrated I am, the more it seems extremely important to do the dishes or workout.  I proscratinate not becaus I'm lazy, but because I'm afraid I'm going to put out a really awful entry.  I need to remember that the reason I suddenly want to exercise is because I'm delaying the inevitable!
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These are two things to keep in my every time I write an entry.  By going down this path, I can likely save myself hours of false starts, needless procrastination and a lot of frustration.  This is hardly the first and it certainly won't be the last thing that I do that I despise...it's time to start learning to work through it.
