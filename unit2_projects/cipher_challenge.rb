# U2.W4: Cipher Challenge


# I worked on this challenge with: .



# 1. Solution
# Write your comments on what each thing is doing. 
# If you have difficulty, go into IRB and play with the methods.



def north_korean_cipher(coded_message)
  input = coded_message.downcase.split("") # Check out this method in IRB to see how it works! Also refer to the ruby docs.
  decoded_sentence = []
  alphabet = ('a'..'z').to_a #setting variable to store alphabet, this can be used later for cipher
  symbols = ['@', '#', '$', '%', '^', '&', '*'] #variable used to store symbols
  cipher = alphabet.rotate(-4)
            
  input.each do |x| # What is #each doing here?
    found_match = false  # Why would this be assigned to false from the outset? What happens when it's true?
    cipher.each_key do |y| # What is #each_key doing here?
      if x == y  # What is this comparing? Where is it getting x? Where is it getting y? What are those variables really?
      #  puts "I am comparing x and y. X is #{x} and Y is #{y}."
        decoded_sentence << cipher[y]
        found_match = true
        break  # Why is it breaking here?
      elsif x == "@" || x == "#" || x == "$" || x == "%"|| x == "^" || x == "&"|| x =="*" #What the heck is this doing?
        decoded_sentence << " "
        found_match = true
        break
      elsif (0..9).to_a.include?(x) # Try this out in IRB. What does   " (0..9).to_a "    do?
        decoded_sentence << x
        found_match = true
        break
      end

  if decoded_sentence.match(/\d+/) #What is this matching? Look at Rubular for help. 
    decoded_sentence.gsub!(/\d+/) { |num| num.to_i / 100 } #He's been known to exaggerate...
  end

# Reflection
# It wasn't difficult to figure out what the code was doing, but all the excess did make it a bit confusing. Breaking it down line by line made it pretty easy to decipher. Refactoring was a challenge at first, but then we decided it would just be easier to scrap that long, confusing loop entirely and just re-write one from scratch.  Our biggest problem turned out to be just a small error...adding turning our alphabet variable into an array.  Once that was cleared up, the code ran well.  I was able to brush up a bit on regex and the .rotate method, as well as using .include for an actual purpose other than playing around.
