  <h1> My 3 Favorites Websites </h1>

  <h3>#1. <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com">Baseball-reference.com</a>
  <br/>
<em>Why is this one of your favorite sites?</em> <br />
Baseball-reference was born out of the dial-up era.  It catered to an audience who wanted to look up baseball statistics without having to wait for long load times caused by unncessary photos, videos and ads.  The site grew into the definitive resource for historial baseball statistics. If you want to know what Hank Aaron did on April 18th, 1957, Baseball-reference can tell you (he went 1 for 4 with a home run in a 1-0 victory against the Reds!).  It's a seemingly endless wealth of easy-to-access baseball information. <br/><br/>

<em>What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site? </em><br/ >

Using Baseball-reference religiously for years, I'm mostly drawn to the "search" boxes.  The front page actually looks pretty intimidating and cluttered if you aren't used to the site.  Taking a step back, I'm drawn more to the Baseball-Reference.com news section, likely because it is one of the sections that is not white or gray.  Interestingly, this is the part of the site I look at least often. <br/><br/>

<em>How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives. (i.e. "pretty", "elegant", "simple", "dark", "cluttered", "basic" etc)</em><br/>
Cluttered, sterile, intimidating, drab, overwheling.  Looks are not what Baseball-reference is about. <br/><br/>

<em>What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?</em><br/>
Baseball-reference contains statistics from virtually very player, team, game, season in Major League History (and even a good portion of minor league history).  In addition, it allows one to run custom reports with their "season finder" and "player finder" tools and contains a wiki pages of baseball information.  It is an extremely easy to use, comprehensive baseball resource. It can be easily navigated in ways other online baseball resources simply cannot and contains far more information than any other baseball site I have seen. <br/><br/>

<em>What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? (i.e. "practical", "fun", "whimsical", "silly", "serious" etc) How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?</em><br/>

Practical, comprehensive, frivilous, historical, purposeful.  Again, Baseball-reference isn't about looks, it's about the content. <br/><br/>

<em>How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?</em>

The search functions are extremely easy to use, and in-page links make it extremely easy to waste hours on this site.  For example, I look up Hank Aaron's career stats.  I can then click on a year and see the entire teams stats for that year.  I can click on a link to see the league's standings for that year. I can then click on that postseason links for a given year, etc...</br></br>

<em>How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?</em></br>

It would likely be impossible.  It contains individual pages for virtually ever player and team in baseball history, including individual game logs. <br/></br>


<em>How do you feel after being on the site for a while? (i.e. "bored", "happy", "anxious or hyper", "like I wasted a lot of time" etc)</em><br/>

Like I wasted an a lot of time. It is extremely easy to get sucked into a baseball-reference wormhole and not emerge for hours. <br/><br/>


<em>Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?</em></br>

They offer a reporting tool for something like $5 a month. If you want to find out which players had the highest batting averages ranging in the seasons from 1956-1965, this could provide that list. I've used it in the past, but mostly I don't.  Another website offers a similiar reporting tool for free, so I just use that. <br/><br/>

<h3>#2. <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia.org</a>
  <br/>
<em>Why is this one of your favorite sites?</em> <br />
Because I clearly like dense, drab looking websites! Like Baseball-reference, it's a quick, easy-to-use and contains a vast wealth of easy-to-access information. <br/><br/>

<em>What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site? </em><br/ >

It's drawn to the logo: a globe made of puzzle-pieces featuring characters from a variety of languages. <br/><br/>

<em>How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives. (i.e. "pretty", "elegant", "simple", "dark", "cluttered", "basic" etc)</em><br/>
Simple, organized, bland, gray, boring.  Like baseball-reference, elegent design isn't what the site is about.  <br/><br/>

<em>What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?</em><br/>
It's an extremely easy-to-use and often updated online encyclopedia. The numbers of topics are vast and the quality of usually pretty good.  It's a great resource to get an overview on virtually any topic. <br/><br/>

<em>What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? (i.e. "practical", "fun", "whimsical", "silly", "serious" etc) How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?</em><br/>

Practical, comprehensive, frivilous, historical, purposeful.  Really...I'm not just being lazy, I would use the exact same adjectives that I used to describe baseball-reference.com<br/><br/>

<em>How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?</em>

It's pretty easy to search for any topic and in-article links make jumping to a similar page very simple.</br></br>

<em>How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?</em></br>

Again, virtually impossible.  There are nearly 4.5 million Wikipedia articles. <br/></br>


<em>How do you feel after being on the site for a while? (i.e. "bored", "happy", "anxious or hyper", "like I wasted a lot of time" etc)</em><br/>

Like I wasted an a lot of time.  <br/><br/>


<em>Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?</em></br>

Aside from asking for the occasional donation, they do not try to sell you anything. 

<h3>#3. <a href="http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com">Hardballtalk.com</a>
  <br/>
<em>Why is this one of your favorite sites?</em> <br />
I. DON'T. KNOW!  This exercise truly reveals how uninteresting my web surfing must be to the outside reader. Sorry guys, it's mostly baseball, news, and Wikipedia.  Hardballtalk is merely a blog run by the snarky and entertain Craig Calcaterra.  It's a fun update on baseball news. <br/><br/>

<em>What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site? </em><br/ >

It's drawn to the "top posts" banner in the upper part of the page. <br/><br/>

<em>How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives. (i.e. "pretty", "elegant", "simple", "dark", "cluttered", "basic" etc)</em><br/>
Cluttered, simple, colorful, image-heavy, basic  <br/><br/>

<em>What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?</em><br/>
It doesn't really solve any problems.  It's just a baseball blog and a pretty good one.  It's basically a baseball news aggregator with a bit of entertaining commentary provided.  The world would still function just fine without it.  <br/><br/>

<em>What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? (i.e. "practical", "fun", "whimsical", "silly", "serious" etc) How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?</em><br/>

Funny, mundane, opinionated...two other adjectives that I don't feel like forcing right now. <br/><br/>

<em>How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?</em>

If you're simply looking for the latest news update, pretty easy, as they are right on top of the page.  Finding an old article is extremely difficult.  It is no well archived and the search feature leaves a lot to be desired. </br></br>

<em>How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?</em></br>

It's been around for many years, and has maybe 20 posts a day...so pretty difficult.  <br/></br>


<em>How do you feel after being on the site for a while? (i.e. "bored", "happy", "anxious or hyper", "like I wasted a lot of time" etc)</em><br/>

Like I wasted an a lot of time(This seems to be running theme)  <br/><br/>


<em>Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?</em></br>

Nope.
